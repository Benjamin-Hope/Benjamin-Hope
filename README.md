# Hi, I'm Chris! 👋

## 🚀 About Me

I love working on new projects and learning new things. I have a Masters degree in engineering physics but for some reason I keep learning a lot and new programming languages. 
Can I ever become the best engineer this world has seen? ...
Over the years i had the change to work on a couple of projects outside my specialization.
